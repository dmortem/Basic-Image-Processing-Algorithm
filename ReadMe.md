# Basic Image Processing Related Algorithm
ZJU Image Analysis and Artistic Processing Course Homework
## Objectives:
1. Decode a bmp image, transform the RGB model into YUV model, output the gray image, change the value of Y, transform back to RGB model and output the image of bmp format with encoding operation by myself
2. Decode a bmp image, output the binary image with the input threshold, implement morphological transformation of dilation, erosion, open and close
3. Decode a bmp image, transform the RGB model into YUV model and implement logarithmic operation on the image of YUV model, implement histogram equalization and fitting on both the image of RGB model and YUV model
4. Decode a bmp image, implement geometric transformation of translation, rotation, scale, shear, mirror
5. Decode a bmp image, implement mean filter and laplacian image enhancement.
6. Decode a bmp image, implement bilateral filter
